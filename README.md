# Yaknowboutblogmusic


This application was generated with the [rails_apps_composer](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer) gem
provided by the [RailsApps Project](http://railsapps.github.io/).

## Installing

First of all, you need install Ruby on your machine (skip this if you
already have)

## Installing Ruby

If you have Macosx or Linux, go to terminal

```
  $ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails
```

and wait a little.
I will update for Windows installation latter.

## Installing yaknowboutblogmusic locally:

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/jahpd/yaknowboutblogmusic
   $ cd yaknowboutblogmusic
   $ bundle install
```

### Migration and seed database

In first running, database (SQLite 3.0) must be seed first, to include some posts
examples:

```
  $ rake --tasks
  $ rake db:migrate
  $ rake db:seed
```
  
## Running

```
  $ rails s 
```

This will start a server on 127.0.0.1:3000
If you want to start in another port:

```
  $ rails s - p 3001
```

# Diagnostics

Acessing a webpage like
[this](http://localhost:3000/posts/1/hear?c=5d000080001f00000000000000000508f7f014ae2e34fad792f976127ce795bd535d17482c64acba78844ca0082ba0)
for first time, both ace and termlib fails in load contents. If you
refresh page (Ctrl+R or F5), ace and termlib works properly.

If the application doesn’t work as expected, please [report an issue](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer/issues)
